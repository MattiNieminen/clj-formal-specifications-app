# clj-formal-specifications-app

A browser-based application for clj-formal-specifications.

This is a graphical, browser-based user interface to [clj-formal-specifications]
(https://github.com/MattiNieminen/clj-formal-specifications), a library that I
wrote for creating executable formal specification with Clojure. Before
continuing further, read the documentation of the library itself.

This tool includes an editor with syntax-highlighting to write formal
specifications and try out the examples from the library. In addition,
executing the specification is possible with a small helper, although
writing your own execution commands is possible as well.
